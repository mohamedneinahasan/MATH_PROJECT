    "algebraic_word_problem": "A train leaves station A traveling at 60 mph and another train leaves station B 2 hours later traveling at 75 mph. When will the second train catch up?",
    "reference_answer": "6 hours after it leaves",
    "step_by_step_solution": "Let t be the time in hours the first train travels. Distance = speed \u00d7 time. Distance of first train = 60t. Distance of second train = 75(t - 2). Set the distances equal: 60t = 75(t - 2). Solving gives t = 8, so the second train catches up 6 hours after it leaves.",
