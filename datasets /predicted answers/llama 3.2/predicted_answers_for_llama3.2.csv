2,A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?,$8,4 pens * $2/pen = $8,"Solve the following math problem: A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?
Answer: 8
Explanation: 
First, think about the question and figure out what value the problem is looking for.
Notice that the problem is asking how much 4 pens will cost. So, we need to multiply the cost of 1 pen by the number of pens we have, which is 4.
Now that we know what value we are looking for, look for an equation that can be used to find it.
We can write the equation 2x = 8 where x is the number of pens. We can then solve for x.

The selling price of the TV is $600. We know that the profit is 25% of the selling price of the TV. So, we can write the following equation:
600 - 0.25(600) = 480
600 - 150 = 480

Answer: John has 60 marbles and Anna has 30 marbles.
If we let x be the number of marbles that Anna has, then John has 2x marbles. Since they have a total of 120 marbles, we can write the following equation:
2x + x = 120
Now we need to solve for x. First, we need to subtract 2x from both sides:
2x + x - 2x = 120 - 2x
Now we can add 2x to both sides:
x = 120 - 2x
Now we can solve for x:

Answer: Mike is now 10 years old.
To solve this problem, we first need to figure out how old Mike was 2 years ago. We can do this by subtracting 2 years from Mike's current age.
Mike's current age = 12
Mike's age 2 years ago = 12 - 2 = 10
Now that we know how old Mike was 2 years ago, we can set up an equation to solve for his current age.

Answer: The dimensions of the rectangle are 20 meters by 10 meters.
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. We are given that the perimeter is 60 meters, so we can set up the following equation:
2(l + w) = 60
To solve for l and w, we can use algebra to isolate them:
2l + 2w = 60
2l = 60 - 2w
2l = 58 - 2w
Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

Explanation: Interest is the amount of money a person pays or is paid when they borrow or lend money. The amount of interest is calculated by multiplying the principal, or the original amount of money, by a certain rate or percentage. Interest can be compounded, which means that the interest on the principal is added to the principal, which is then used to calculate the interest on the new amount. This process is repeated each time interest is calculated, and the result is the accumulation of interest over a period of time.
