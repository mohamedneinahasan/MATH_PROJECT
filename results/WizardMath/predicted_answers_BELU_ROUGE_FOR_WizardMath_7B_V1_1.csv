2,A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?,$8,4 pens * $2/pen = $8,"Solve the following math problem: A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?
Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the cost of one pen is $2. This is our starting point.

Next, we want to find out how much four pens will cost. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by the number of pens we want to buy. In this case, we want to buy four pens, so we multiply $2 by 4.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$2 (cost of one pen) x 4 (number of pens) = $8 (total cost of four pens)

So, the total cost of four pens is $8.

Answer: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates.

John's rate of painting is 1 wall per 4 hours, as he takes 4 hours to paint one wall.
Mary's rate of painting is 1 wall per 6 hours, as she takes 6 hours to paint one wall.

When John and Mary work together, their combined rate of painting is the sum of their individual rates. So, their combined rate is:

Discount = $15
Final amount = $90 - $15 = $75","Solve the following math problem: Jack buys 3 shirts, each priced at $30. He gets a $15 discount. How much does he pay?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 3 shirts without any discount. To do this, we multiply the price of one shirt ($30) by the number of shirts Jack buys (3). So, 30 x 3 = $90.

Next, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the shirts. The discount is $15. So, we subtract $15 from $90. This gives us 90 - 15 = $75.

Therefore, Jack pays $75 for the 3 shirts after applying the $15 discount.

The car traveled 100 miles in the first part of the trip and 50 miles in the second part. To find the total distance, we simply add these two distances together:

Total distance = 100 miles + 50 miles = 150 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
The car took 2 hours to travel the first 100 miles and 1 hour to travel the next 50 miles. To find the total time, we add these two",Distance-Rate-Time,Medium,0.02898550724637681,6.3326528443932364e-232

Answer: If the radius of a circle is doubled, the area of the circle will be multiplied by 4.

To understand why, let's first recall the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = πr^2, where A represents the area and r represents the radius of the circle.

Now, let's consider what happens when we double the radius. Let's call the original radius r and the new radius 2r (since it is doubled).

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine the value of the car after the first year. The car depreciates by 20% each year, so after the first year, the value of the car will be 100% - 20% = 80% of its original value. 

To calculate this, we can multiply the original value of the car by 80% (or 0.8). 

So, the value of the car after the first year is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we know that the price of the shirt after a 25% discount is $40. This means that the shirt is priced at 75% of its original price because the discounted price is the original price minus 25% of the original price. 

We can represent this relationship mathematically as follows:

Original Price * 0.75 = $40

Here, 0.75 is the decimal equivalent of 75%, and it represents the proportion of the original price that remains after the 25% discount.

What is the average speed for the entire journey?
Answer: Let's think step by step.Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the outward journey.
We know that speed = distance/time, so time = distance/speed.
For the outward journey, the distance is 120 km and the speed is 60 km/h.
So, the time taken for the outward journey (t1) is 120/60 = 2 hours.

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time it takes to complete a job. In this case, we are given that 5 workers can complete a job in 10 days. This means that the total work required to complete the job is 5 workers * 10 days = 50 worker-days. This is because each worker works for 10 days, so the total work done is 5 * 10 = 50.

For Car A, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. 
So, Distance_A = 60 km/h x 2 hours = 120 km.

For Car B, we use the same formula: Distance = Speed x Time. 
So, Distance_B = 90 km/h x 2 hours = 180 km.

Water is being drained at a rate of 5 liters per hour and added at a rate of 10 liters per hour. How long will it take to fill the container?
Answer: First, we need to determine the net rate of change of water in the container. This is done by subtracting the rate at which water is being drained from the rate at which water is being added. 

So, the net rate of change is 10 liters per hour (rate of addition) minus 5 liters per hour (rate of drainage), which equals 5 liters per hour.

In this problem, the base is 8 cm and the height is 5 cm. Let's plug these values into the formula:

Area = (8 * 5) / 2

Now, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

Area = (40) / 2

Next, we divide 40 by 2:

Area = 20

So, the area of the triangle is 20 square centimeters.

The answer is: the area of the triangle is 20 square",Geometry,Easy,0.018518518518518517,5.587772457628148e-232

If it maintains the same speed, how far will it travel in 7 hours?
Answer: First, we need to find the train's speed. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, the train travels 150 miles in 3 hours. So, the speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 50 miles per hour (mph)

Now that we know the train's speed, we can find out how far it will travel in 7 hours. To do this, we simply multiply the speed by the time:

Answer: 
First, we are given two equations: x + 2y = 10 and y = 3.

A1 = πr^2

Next, we are given that the radius is increased by 50%. This means the new radius r' is:

r' = r + 0.5r = 1.5r

Now, we can find the new area A2 using the new radius r':

A2 = π(1.5r)^2

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to identify the cost of one book. According to the problem, one book costs $15.

Next, we need to determine how many books we are buying. The problem states that we are buying 4 books.

To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one book by the number of books we are buying. This is because the total cost is the sum of the cost of each individual book.

So, we multiply $15 (the cost of one book) by 4 (the number of books).

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand the problem. We are given that the sum of two numbers is 40, and one of the numbers is 12. We are asked to find the other number.

Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. According to the problem, we know that:

x + y = 40

We also know that one of the numbers is 12, so we can say:

x = 12

Now, we can substitute x = 12 into the first equation to find the value of y:

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we know that a dozen eggs cost $3. This means that the cost of one dozen eggs is $3.

Next, we need to find out the cost of 3 dozen eggs. To do this, we can multiply the cost of one dozen eggs by 3. This is because there are 3 dozens in total.

So, we calculate as follows:

Cost of one dozen eggs * 3 = Total cost of 3 dozens
$3 * 3 = $9

Therefore, the cost of 3 dozen eggs is $9.

So, the final answer is $\boxed{9}$.

Answer: The average speed of the bike can be found by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. In this case, the bike travels 60 miles in 2 hours. So, the average speed is:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 60 miles / 2 hours

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

Average speed = (60 miles ÷ 2) / (2 hours ÷ 2)
Average speed = 30 miles / 1 hour
