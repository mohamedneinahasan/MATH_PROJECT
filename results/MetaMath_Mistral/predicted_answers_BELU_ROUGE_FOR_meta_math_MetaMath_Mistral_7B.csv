w = 10, l = 20","Solve the following math problem: A rectangle has a perimeter of 60 meters. If the length is twice the width, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?
Answer: Let the width of the rectangle be $w$.
Since the length is twice the width, the length is $2w$.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by $2(\text{length} + \text{width})$.
So we have $2(2w + w) = 60$.
Simplifying, we get $6w = 60$.
Dividing both sides by 6, we find $w = 10$.
Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are $10$ meters by $2(10) = 20$ meters.

For 10 cups of flour, milk = (1/2) * 10 = 5 cups.","Solve the following math problem: A recipe uses 2 cups of milk for every 4 cups of flour. How much milk is needed for 10 cups of flour?
Answer: If 2 cups of milk are used for every 4 cups of flour, then the ratio of milk to flour is 2:4, or 1:2.
To find out how much milk is needed for 10 cups of flour, we can set up a proportion:
2 cups of milk / 4 cups of flour = x cups of milk / 10 cups of flour
Cross multiplying, we get 4x = 2 * 10
Simplifying, we get 4x = 20
Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 5
Therefore, 5 cups of milk are needed for 10 cups of flour.

When will the second train catch up?
Answer: The first train is traveling at 60 mph and the second train is traveling at 75 mph.
To find when the second train will catch up, we need to determine when the distance traveled by the second train is equal to or greater than the distance traveled by the first train.
The distance traveled by the first train in 2 hours is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.
The distance traveled by the second train in 2 hours is 75 mph * 2 hours = 150 miles.
Since the second train is traveling faster, it will catch up when its distance is greater than or equal to 120 miles.

If it initially travels 15 km/l and 50 kg of weight is added, what is the new efficiency?
Answer: The car's fuel efficiency decreases by 5% for every 10 kg of additional weight.
If 50 kg of weight is added, the car's fuel efficiency will decrease by 5% of 50 kg, which is 5% * 50 kg = 2.5 kg.
The car's initial fuel efficiency is 15 km/l.
After adding 50 kg of weight, the car's fuel efficiency will be 15 km/l - 2.5 km/l = 12.5 km/l.
The new efficiency is 12.5 km/l.

A second train leaves the same station at 11 AM and travels at 100 km/h in the same direction. At what time will the second train catch up with the first?
Answer: To find the time when the second train catches up with the first train, we need to determine the relative speed between the two trains.
The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is 100 km/h - 80 km/h = 20 km/h.
Since the distance between the two trains is the same as the distance between the starting point and the point where they meet, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

If a customer is charged $80, how many kilometers did they drive?
Answer: Let's assume the number of kilometers driven is x.
The base fee is $40, so the total charge is $40 + $0.20x.
We are given that the total charge is $80, so we can set up the equation:
$40 + $0.20x = $80
Subtract $40 from both sides of the equation to isolate $0.20x:
$0.20x = $40
Divide both sides of the equation by $0.20 to solve for x:
x = $40 / $0.20 = 200

If the mother is twice as old as the daughter, how old is each?
Answer: Let's assume the daughter's age is x.
Since the mother is twice as old as the daughter, the mother's age is 2x.
The combined ages of the mother and daughter are 72 years, so x + 2x = 72.
Combining like terms, we have 3x = 72.
Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 24.
Therefore, the daughter is 24 years old and the mother is 2(24) = 48 years old.

If the ladder is 10 meters long, what is the height it reaches on the wall?
Answer: We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve this problem.
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
In this case, the base of the ladder is 8 meters and the length of the ladder is 10 meters.

If the total bill is $40, how many texts were sent?
Answer: The base charge is $25, and the total bill is $40, so the remaining amount is $40 - $25 = $15.
We know that each text message costs $0.12, so we can divide the remaining amount by $0.12 to find the number of text messages.
$15 / $0.12 = 125
