Let's denote the number of marbles Anna has as A and the number of marbles John has as J.

We know two things from the problem:

1. The total number of marbles is 120, so A + J = 120.

2. John has twice as many marbles as Anna, so J = 2A.

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for A:

Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the probability of an event occurring is calculated by dividing the number of ways the event can occur by the total number of outcomes.

In this case, the event is selecting a red ball, and the number of ways this can occur is 3 (since there are 3 red balls).

The total number of outcomes is the total number of balls in the bag, which is 3 (red) + 4 (green) + 2 (blue) = 9 balls.

So, the probability of selecting a red ball is 3 (red balls) divided by 9 (total balls) = 1/3.

Answer:

If the ratio of cats to dogs is 4:3, then for every 4 cats, there are 3 dogs.

We are given that there are 28 cats. To find out how many groups of 4 cats there are, we divide the total number of cats by the number of cats per group:

Number of groups = Total cats / Cats per group
= 28 / 4
= 7

So, there are 7 groups of 4 cats each. Since each group of cats corresponds to a group of 3 dogs, we can find the total number of dogs by multiplying the number of groups by the number of dogs per group:

Answer: The other two angles are 45 degrees each.

This is because, in a right triangle, the right angle is 90 degrees. The other two angles must add up to 90 degrees as well. So, if one of those angles is x degrees, the other angle must be (90 - x) degrees. But since both angles are equal in a right isosceles triangle, x = (90 - x), which means x = 45 degrees.

If there are 21 boys, how many girls are there?
Answer: \boxed{28}

There are 21 boys in the class. The ratio of boys to girls is 3:4. This means that for every 3 boys, there are 4 girls.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 3 boys there are:

Number of sets = Total number of boys / Number of boys per set
Number of sets = 21 / 3
Number of sets = 7

Since there are 7 sets of 3 boys, and each set has 4 girls, we can find the total number of girls by multiplying the number of sets by the number of girls per set:

Here's the step-by-step solution:
1. Let's denote the original price of the dress as $x.
2. After a 20% discount, the price of the dress becomes $x - 0.20x = 0.80x.
3. We're given that the discounted price is $80, so we can set up the equation: 0.80x = $80.
4. To find the original price, we need to solve for $x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.80: x = $8",Percentages,Medium,0.01785714285714286,0.0
