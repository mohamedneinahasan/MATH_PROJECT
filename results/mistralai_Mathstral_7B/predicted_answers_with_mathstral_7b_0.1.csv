Let's denote the speed of the cyclist without wind as S (in km/h) and the speed of the wind as W (in km/h).

The cyclist covers 150 km in 3 hours with a tailwind, which means their effective speed with the tailwind is 150/3 = 50 km/h.

The tailwind decreases their time by 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. This means that if the cyclist had to cover the same distance without the wind, it would take them 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 hours.
