Answer: 200 miles
Explanation: The trains are traveling at a combined rate of 140 miles per hour. In 2 hours they will travel 280 miles. If you draw a triangle with the trains as two of the angles and a 90 degree angle at the starting point, you can see that the angle formed by the two trains is 80 degrees.

Percentage increase = 100 × (new value − old value)/old value
Percentage decrease = 100 × (old value − new value)/old value
Let’s consider an example to understand this concept.
Suppose the price of an item is $120. The price increases to $150.
Let’s find the percentage increase in the price.
First, we will find the difference between the new and old value.
New value = $150
Old value = $120
Difference = $150 − $120 = $30

Answer: $300
Explanation: The math problem is asking you to find the amount they should budget if they want to spend 25% less.
To find 25% of 400, you can multiply the amount by 0.25. 0.25 x 400 = 100, so 25% of $400 is $100.
To find 75%, or 100% minus 25%, you can subtract 25% from 100%. 100% - 25% = 75%, so 75% of $400 is $300.

What is the average speed for the entire trip?,58.33 km/h,Let the distance be d; Time for A to B = d/50; Time for B to A = d/70; Average speed = Total distance / Total time.,"Solve the following math problem: A car travels from city A to city B at a speed of 50 km/h and returns at a speed of 70 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire trip?
Answer: 60 km/h
Explanation: The average speed for the round trip is given by the formula:
average speed = total distance / total time
Let's calculate the total distance traveled:
distance A to B = 50 km / h * 3 hours = 150 km
distance B to A = 70 km / h * 2 hours = 140 km
total distance = 150 km + 140 km = 290 km
Let's calculate the total time traveled:
time A to B = 3 hours
time B to A = 2 hours
total time = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours
average speed = 290 km / 5 hours = 58 km / h

Answer: 100
Explanation: The first step is to write the given information in an equation. The equation should include the base charge of $25, the charge per text message, and the total bill. The equation is 25 + 0.12n = 40, where n is the number of text messages sent.
The next step is to solve the equation for n. First, subtract 25 from both sides of the equation. This leaves 0.12n = 15. Then, divide each side by 0.12. This leaves n = 125. However, since there cannot be negative text messages, n must be 100.",Linear Equations,Easy,0.03076923076923077,5.4163389104701204e-232

659,A runner travels 9 km in 40 minutes. What is their average speed in km/h?,13.5 km/h,Average speed = Distance / Time = 9 / (40/60) = 13.5 km/h.,"Solve the following math problem: A runner travels 9 km in 40 minutes. What is their average speed in km/h?
Answer: 24 km/h
Step-by-step explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for speed, which is: speed = distance/time
Since we know the distance and time, we can plug those values into the formula and solve for speed. speed = 9 km / 40 min speed = 0.225 km/min
To convert this value to km/h, we need to multiply it by 60. 0.225 km/min x 60 = 13.5 km/h
Therefore, the runner's average speed is 13.5 km/h.

Answer: This is not a right triangle.
Explanation: A right triangle is a triangle with one of the angles equal to 90 degrees. Therefore, a right triangle has two acute angles, which are angles less than 90 degrees.
In this triangle, the largest angle is the angle opposite the side of length 25, so that angle is the right angle. The other two angles are acute angles, so the triangle is not a right triangle.
Another way to determine whether this is a right triangle is to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.

Answer: The integers are 15 and 16.
The product of two consecutive integers is 240. What are the integers?
The product of two consecutive integers is 240.
Let the first number be x. Then the second number is x + 1.
So, the product of two consecutive integers is:
x (x + 1) = 240
x² + x = 240
x² + x – 240 = 0
