Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to use a formula that relates the time it takes to complete a task to the individual times it takes to complete the task. This formula is:
T = 1 / (1/t1 + 1/t2)
where t1 and t2 are the times it takes the individual workers to complete the task, and T is the time it takes to complete the task when both workers work together.
In this case, we have t1 = 4 hours and t2 = 6 hours, so we can plug these values into the formula to get:

Answer:
The dimensions of the garden are 5 meters by 10 meters.
Explanation:
The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of its four sides.
Let’s assume the length of the garden is x meters and the width is y meters. The perimeter of the garden is 30 meters, so we can write the equation:
2x + 2y = 30

Last year’s revenue was $120,000. What is this year’s revenue?
Answer: The correct answer is $138,000.
Solution: The formula for calculating the percentage increase is (New Value – Old Value) / Old Value × 100%. In this case, the New Value is the unknown revenue for this year, and the Old Value is last year’s revenue of $120,000. We are told that the revenue increased by 15%, so we can use the formula to calculate the New Value:

Distance = 40 * 12 = 480 miles","Solve the following math problem: A car can travel 200 miles on 5 gallons of gas. How many miles can it travel on 12 gallons?
Answer: 480 miles
Solving this math problem requires the use of proportion. In this case, we are comparing miles driven to gallons used. If we know that 200 miles can be driven on 5 gallons, we can find the number of miles that can be driven on 12 gallons by setting up a proportion.
200 miles : 5 gallons = x miles : 12 gallons
To solve for x, we can cross multiply:
200 x 12 = 5 x
2400 = 5x
x = 480 miles
Therefore, the car can travel 480 miles on 12 gallons of gas.

Let’s look at what we know:
- The original price of the item was $120.
- The new price of the item is $150.
- The question is asking for the percentage increase.
To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference between the new price and the original price, and then divide that difference by the original price.
The difference between the new price and the original price is: $150 – $120 = $30.

Answer:
The width of the rectangle is 16 meters.
Explanation:
The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. The perimeter of this rectangle is 52 meters.
The length of the rectangle is 18 meters.
The width of the rectangle is the length of its two opposite sides.
We can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the width of the rectangle:
Perimeter = 2(length) + 2(width)

Answer: 10%
Explanation:
The cost price of the TV is $500. The selling price is $450.
The loss is the difference between the cost price and the selling price.
So, loss = cost price - selling price
loss = $500 - $450
loss = $50
To calculate the percentage loss, we divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100.
percentage loss = (loss/cost price) × 100
percentage loss = ($50/$500) × 100

Answer: 25%
Solution:
We need to calculate the profit as a percentage of the original price.
To do this, we use the following formula:
Profit as a percentage = (Profit ÷ Original Price) × 100
In this case, the profit is $50 – $40 = $10, and the original price is $40.
So, the profit as a percentage is:
Profit as a percentage = (10 ÷ 40) × 100

231,A rectangle has a perimeter of 64 meters and its width is 14 meters. What is its length?,18 meters,"Perimeter of rectangle = 2(Length + Width)
64 = 2(L + 14)
64 = 2L + 28
2L = 36
L = 36 / 2 = 18 meters","Solve the following math problem: A rectangle has a perimeter of 64 meters and its width is 14 meters. What is its length?
Answer:
The answer is 22 meters.
Explanation:
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(l + w)
Where l = length and w = width
64 = 2(l + 14)
Divide both sides by 2.
32 = l + 14
Subtract 14 from both sides.
32 – 14 = l + 14 – 14
18 = l
l = 18 meters

Answer: 20%
Explanation: To find the percentage spent on groceries, divide $120 by the total expenses of $300 ($120 + $80 + $200). This gives you 0.4, which is the decimal form of the percentage. To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100, resulting in 40%. However, the question asks for the percentage spent on groceries, not the percentage spent on all expenses. So, the answer is 20%, because 20% of the total expenses are spent on groceries.

Side length = 36 / 4 = 9 meters","Solve the following math problem: The perimeter of a square is 36 meters. What is the length of each side?
Answer: The length of each side of the square is 9 meters.
Explanation:
The perimeter of a square is the length of its boundary. The formula to calculate the perimeter of a square is 4 x side length.
Therefore, the perimeter of a square is 36 meters, and 36 meters = 4 x side length
To find the length of each side of the square, we divide 36 meters by 4.
36 meters ÷ 4 = 9 meters
Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 9 meters.

The area of a triangle is given by A = 1/2 * b * h, where A is the area, b is the base, and h is the height.
In this case, A = 24, b = 8, and we need to solve for h.
Plugging in the values, we get: 24 = 1/2 * 8 * h.

Answer: 1/4 of the job
Explanation: 
Explanation:
First, let's determine how much the worker can complete in one hour. To do this, we divide the job into 8 equal parts and determine how many parts the worker can complete in one hour. This gives us 1/8 of the job per hour.
Next, we want to determine how much the worker can complete in two hours. To do this, we simply multiply the amount he can complete in one hour by two. This gives us 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4. Therefore, the worker can complete 1/4 of the job in two hours.

Answer: We can use a ratio to solve this problem. The ratio of flour to sugar is 2:3. This means that for every 2 cups of flour, there are 3 cups of sugar. We can use this ratio to find the amount of flour needed for 9 cups of sugar.
To do this, we need to find the number of cups of flour that is equivalent to 9 cups of sugar. We know that the ratio of flour to sugar is 2:3, so we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of cups of flour:

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:
Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys
We know that the school has 200 students and that 60% of them are girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls like this:
Number of girls = 200 x 0.6
Number of girls = 120
Now we can use the formula to calculate the number of boys:

Answer: 15 gallons
Explanation: The car uses 5 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. To find out how much gas it would use to travel 300 miles, we can use a proportion. The proportion would be:
(5 gallons / 100 miles) = (x gallons / 300 miles)

x = (5 gallons * 300 miles) / 100 miles
x = 15 gallons
Therefore, the car would use 15 gallons of gas to travel 300 miles.

Answer: 3 x 2/3 cups of sugar
Step-by-step explanation:
The key to solving this problem is to recognize that we are being asked to multiply 2/3 by 3.
The reason we multiply by 3 is because we want to know how much sugar is needed for 3 batches.
To multiply 2/3 by 3, we need to multiply the numerator (2) by 3:
2/3 x 3 = 6/3
Next, we need to simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:
6/3 ÷ 3/3 = 2/1 or 2

Answer: 4 hours
Explanation:
Step 1: Determine the rate of the boat in still water:
Rate of boat downstream = 28 mph
Rate of boat upstream = 15 mph
Rate of boat in still water = (Rate downstream + Rate upstream) / 2
= (28 + 15) / 2
= 43 / 2
= 21.5 mph
Step 2: Find the time it takes to travel 60 miles upstream at a speed of 21.5 mph:

Answer:
If the sides of a triangle are in the ratio 3:4:5, the sides must be 15 cm, 20 cm, and 25 cm.
First, let’s divide 60 by 3+4+5 to find the scale factor:
60/12 = 5
Now, to find the lengths of the sides, we just multiply each number in the ratio by 5:
3×5 = 15

Answer:
$35
Explanation:
If a sweater originally costs $50 and is on sale for 30% off, the sale price is $35.
The formula for calculating the sale price is:
Sale Price = Original Price – (Original Price x Discount Percentage)
In this case, the original price is $50 and the discount percentage is 30%.
The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage.
Discount Amount = $50 x 30% = $15
To calculate the sale price, subtract the discount amount from the original price.

Answer: 4 hours
Explanation: First, we need to determine how much work each worker can do in one hour. Since it takes 4 workers 6 hours to complete a task, each worker can do 1/24 of the task in one hour. Therefore, 6 workers can do 6/24 = 1/4 of the task in one hour. To determine how long it will take to complete the task with 6 workers, we simply need to divide 1 by 1/4. This gives us 1 ÷ 1/4 = 4.

If one ball is drawn at random, what is the probability it is not blue?
Answer:
To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:
Probability = (Number of desired outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

Answer: 11 km/h
Step-by-step explanation:
Let the speed of boat in still water be x km/h
Speed of the current = 2 km/h
Speed of boat upstream = x – 2 km/h
Speed of boat downstream = x + 2 km/h
Time taken to cover 15 km upstream = 15/(x – 2) h
Time taken to cover 25 km downstream = 25/(x + 2) h

What is the average speed for the entire trip?
Answer: 58.33 km/h
Explanation:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Let the distance between city A and city B be x km.
Time taken to go from city A to city B = x / 50
Time taken to return from city B to city A = x / 70
Total distance = x + x = 2x
Total time = x / 50 + x / 70 = 12x/350
Average speed = 2x / (12x/350) = 58.33 km/h
Therefore, the answer is 58.33 km/h.

Answer:
The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula: V = πr²h
Where V is the volume, π is a mathematical constant (approximately equal to 3.14), r is the radius of the cylinder, and h is its height.
In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm, so the volume is:
V = π(5 cm)²(10 cm)

Answer: 2 hours
Explanation:
If you have two objects with different speeds, the faster one will always catch up to the slower one. This is because the faster one is going faster than the slower one. If you can’t see it, you can calculate it. The formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. If you have two objects that have different speeds but the same time, then the faster one will travel a greater distance. In this case, the second train is going 90 km/h and the first train is going 60 km/h. So, the second train will travel 90 km/h * 2 hours = 180 km.

How much pure water should be added to dilute it to a 20% solution?
Answer: 50 ml of water should be added.
Explanation:
The initial amount of saline solution is 200 ml and its concentration is 30%. Therefore, the initial amount of saline is:
200 ml * 0.3 = 60 ml
The final concentration of the solution should be 20%, which means that the final amount of saline should be:

If a chef wants to make a batch using 900 grams of sugar, how much flour is needed to keep the recipe ratio?
Answer: 600 grams of flour is needed to keep the recipe ratio.
Explanation:
To keep the recipe ratio, the chef needs to use 3 times more flour than sugar. Therefore, if the chef uses 900 grams of sugar, they need to use 3 times more flour, which is 3 x 200 grams = 600 grams.
Thus, in order to keep the ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe, the chef needs to use 600 grams of flour to match the 900 grams of sugar.

When will the second bus catch up?,9 AM,Distance first bus travels in 1 hour = 60 km; Relative speed = 80 - 60 = 20 km/h; Time to catch up = 60 / 20 = 3 hours.,"Solve the following math problem: A bus leaves at 6 AM and travels at 60 km/h. Another bus leaves the same station at 7 AM at 80 km/h. When will the second bus catch up?
Answer:
I have solved this question in two ways:
1. Using the fact that the distance is the same for both buses
2. Using the fact that the time is the same for both buses
Let's start with the first way.
The distance is the same for both buses. I have calculated the distance for each bus separately.
For the first bus:
Distance = 60 km/h * (t + 1)
For the second bus:
Distance = 80 km/h * t
60 km/h * (t + 1) = 80 km/h * t
60 t + 60 = 80 t

How long will it take to fill the tank if both pipes are opened together?,7.2 hours,Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/18; Total time = 1 / (1/12 + 1/18).,"Solve the following math problem: A storage tank can be filled by Pipe A in 12 hours and by Pipe B in 18 hours. How long will it take to fill the tank if both pipes are opened together?
Answer: 7.2 hours
Here’s how to solve it.
If pipe A can fill the tank in 12 hours, then in one hour it can fill 1/12 of the tank.
If pipe B can fill the tank in 18 hours, then in one hour it can fill 1/18 of the tank.
So, together, in one hour, the two pipes can fill 1/12 + 1/18 = 3/36 + 2/36 = 5/36 of the tank.
To fill the whole tank, it will take 36/5 hours = 7.2 hours.

Answer: Sarah has 30 marbles.
In this problem, we can use a variable (x) to represent the number of marbles Sarah has. Since Sarah has twice as many marbles as Tom, we can represent the number of marbles Sarah has as 2x.
We know that Tom has 15 marbles. This means that Sarah has twice as many marbles as Tom, so we can write an equation to represent this relationship:
2x = 15
We want to solve for x, the number of marbles Sarah has. To do this, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.

Answer: The length of the rectangle is 12 meters.
Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:
Area = length x width
We know the area of the rectangle is 48 square meters, and the width is 4 meters. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
48 = length x 4
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
length = 12 meters
Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 12 meters.",Area Problems,Medium,0.038461538461538464,1.7352979552035072e-155

Answer:
The original price of the jacket was $160.
Step-by-step explanation:
Let x be the original price of the jacket.
Given that,
A person buys a jacket for $120 after a 25% discount.
So, we get;
25% of x = $120
 \dfrac{25}{100} \times x=120 
 x=\dfrac{120 \times 100}{25} 
 x=4800/25 
 \boxed{x=192}

Answer: $17,000
Explanation:
To calculate the value of a car after 1 year, we first need to find its depreciation:
Depreciation = (15/100) x $20,000 = $3,000
Then we subtract the depreciation from the initial cost:
Value after 1 year = $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000

If the length is 10 meters, what is the width?
Answer: 5 meters.
The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of its four sides. In this case, the length is 10 meters and the width is unknown. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for the width:
Perimeter = 30 meters
Length = 10 meters
Width = x meters

Answer: x < 5
Explanation: The solution to an inequality is a range of values that satisfy the inequality. To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the inequality. To do this, we need to do the opposite operation of 5, which is addition. We add 5 to both sides of the inequality to get 3x < 15. Next, we need to do the opposite operation of 3, which is division. We divide both sides of the inequality by 3 to get x < 5. Therefore, the solution to the inequality 3x - 5 < 10 is x < 5.

## Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution
In order to solve this math problem, we need to apply the concept of triangles.
We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always equal to 180 degrees.
We also know that one of the angles in the triangle is 90 degrees.
To find the other two angles, we can use the following formula:
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180 degrees
One angle = 90 degrees
Other two angles = ?
Substituting the known values in the formula, we get:

If you want to make a batch using 12 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar do you need?
Answer: 9 cups of sugar are needed for the recipe.
Explanation:
To solve this math problem, we can use a proportion. We know that 4 cups of flour is used for every 3 cups of sugar, and we want to use 12 cups of flour. We can set up the proportion as follows:
4/3 = 12/x
where x is the number of cups of sugar needed. We can solve for x by cross-multiplying:
4x = 36
x = 9
Therefore, 9 cups of sugar are needed for the recipe.

Step-by-step explanation:
Let x be the measure of the other two angles.
We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.
Hence, the angles are 40°, x°, and x°.
We know that
40° + x° + x° = 180°
2x° + 40° = 180°

If an item costs $50 before the discount, what is the sale price?
Answer: $40
Solution:
The sale price is the price of an item after the discount.
The discount is 20% of the original price, which is 20% of $50.
20% of $50 is $10, so the discount is $10.
The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is $50 minus $10.
$50 minus $10 is $40, so the sale price is $40.
Therefore, the correct answer is $40.

842,"If 3x + 2 = 17, what is the value of x?",x = 5,Subtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 15; Divide by 3: x = 5.,"Solve the following math problem: If 3x + 2 = 17, what is the value of x?
Answer: x = 5
Explanation:
To solve this math problem, we need to isolate the variable, x, on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations on both sides of the equation.
The first step is to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
3x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2
Simplifying both sides gives us:
3x = 15
Now we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:
(3x)/3 = 15/3
Simplifying both sides gives us:
x = 5
Therefore, the value of x is 5.

If you have 6 cups of flour, how much sugar is needed?
Answer: 24/3 = 8 cups
Solution:
Let's start by defining the variables:
x = the amount of sugar needed
y = the amount of flour used
z = the amount of sugar needed for every 3 cups of flour
We can set up a proportion to solve for x:
x/y = z/3
Since we know that y = 6 cups of flour, we can substitute that in:
x/6 = z/3
We also know that z = 2 cups of sugar, so we can substitute that in:
x/6 = 2/3

Answer: The length of the rectangle is 15 cm.
Let's break down the problem step by step.
The length of a rectangle is always greater than its width. We are told that the length is 5 cm more than the width.
Therefore, we can write:
length = width + 5
The width of the rectangle is 10 cm.
Therefore, we can write:
width = 10 cm
Now, we can substitute the width into the first equation to solve for the length.

Answer:
$75

## Math Puzzle Solution Explained
To solve this math equation, we first need to determine the cost of one cookie. To do this, we divide the total cost ($15) by the number of cookies (10). This gives us a cost of $1.50 per cookie.
Once we know the cost of one cookie, we can multiply this amount by the number of cookies we are interested in. In this case, we are interested in 50 cookies, so we multiply $1.50 by 50. This gives us a total cost of $75 for 50 cookies.
Therefore, the answer to the math puzzle is $75.

Answer: 28 m
Explanation: To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.
In this case, the length is 10 m and the width is 4 m. Therefore, the perimeter is:
P = 2(10 + 4) = 28 m
So the perimeter of the rectangle is 28 m.

Answer: 7
The area of a square is the product of its length and width. In this case, both the length and width are equal, so we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is A = s², where s is the length of one side.
We are given that the area of the square is 49 cm², so we can substitute this value into the equation and solve for s.
A = s²

976,"If the length of a rectangle is doubled and the width remains the same, how does the area change?",The area doubles.,Let length = l and width = w; Area = l × w; New area = 2l × w = 2 × (l × w).,"Solve the following math problem: If the length of a rectangle is doubled and the width remains the same, how does the area change?
Answer: The area will double.
Explanation:
Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangle.
Then the area of the rectangle can be found by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle.
A = L × W
If the length is doubled, it becomes 2L.
The area changes to:
A = 2L × W
= 2(L × W)
= 2(A)
Therefore, if the length is doubled and the width remains the same, then the area will double.
