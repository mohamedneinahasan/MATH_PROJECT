Answer:

Answer:
The cost price of the TV was $500.
Explanation:
The store made a 25% profit on the TV, which means the selling price was 25% more than the cost price.
Let the cost price of the TV be x.
Then, the selling price = x + 25% of x = x + 0.25x = 1.25x

Answer: They are 100 miles apart.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the distance between the trains after 2 hours. The north train has traveled 60 miles in 2 hours, while the east train has traveled 80 miles in 2 hours. We can form a right triangle with the north train as one leg and the east train as the other leg, and the distance between them as the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we can write:

Answer: $160


Step 1: Determine the amount of interest earned in one year.
The annual interest rate is 4%, which means that the person will earn 4% of the initial deposit in one year. To calculate this, we can multiply the initial deposit by the interest rate:
$2,000 * 0.04 = $80

Step 2: Calculate the total interest earned in two years.

Answer: 60 miles per hour

The question is asking you to calculate the speed of the train, which is defined as the distance traveled divided by the time taken. Given that the train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, we can use the formula speed = distance ÷ time to find the answer.

Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get:

speed = 120 miles ÷ 2 hours = 60 miles per hour

Therefore, the train’s speed is 60 miles per hour. It’s important to note that the units of speed should match the units of distance and time, so in this case we use miles per hour.

Answer: ____ students

If we assume that all the 30 students took the test, then we can find the number of students who passed by multiplying the percent of students who passed by the total number of students.

$$ \frac{\text{number of students who passed}}{\text{total number of students}} = 60\% $$ $$ \frac{\text{number of students who passed}}{30} = \frac{60}{100} $$

We can solve for the number of students who passed by multiplying both sides by 30.

$$ \text{number of students who passed} = \frac{60}{100} \cdot 30 $$

Hello,

The ratio is 3:4, which means that for every 3 cats there are 4 dogs. So, if there are 21 cats, we can set up a proportion to find the number of dogs:

3:4 = 21:x

where x is the number of dogs.

To solve for x, we can use the fact that the ratio of cats to dogs is the same in both parts of the proportion. So, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

273,A store sells a shirt for $40 after a 20% discount. What was the original price?,$50,"Let the original price be x.
0.80x = 40
x = 40 / 0.80 = 50.","Solve the following math problem: A store sells a shirt for $40 after a 20% discount. What was the original price?
Answer: The original price of the shirt was $50.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

Discount amount = Original price × Discount percentage

Discount amount = $40 × 20%

Discount amount = $40 × 0.2

Discount amount = $8

Step 2: Subtract the discount amount from the discounted price to find the original price.

Original price = Discounted price + Discount amount

Original price = $40 + $8

Original price = $48

Therefore, the original price of the shirt was $48.

Hint: We know the definition of percentage as the fraction whose denominator is 100. Now, we can say that if we have an expression of the form $\dfrac{x}{y}$, then to convert it into percentage we can use the formula $\dfrac{x \times 100}{y}$. This will give us the percentage if we divide $\dfrac{x}{y}$ into $y$ parts. If we have to find the fraction of $\dfrac{x}{y}$ into $z$ parts, then we can use the formula $\dfrac{x \times z}{y}$.

Answer: $ =
(Round your answer to the nearest cent)


Get solution
Step-by-step explanation
Step 1 of 3:
The original price of the car is P=$25,000
Rate of depreciation per year = R=15%=0.15
Number of years, T=4
To find out the value of the car after 4 years, we need to substitute the values in the formula,

Answer: $250

In the above math problem, the 20% discount is the discount rate, and the $200 is the discounted price. To calculate the original price, we need to solve for the original price, which we will call x.

We know that the discounted price is 20% less than the original price, so we can write an equation:

Discounted price = Original price - 20% of Original price
$200 = x - 0.20x
$200 = 0.80x

Answer:
In order to find out if the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a = 5 cm, b = 12 cm, and c = 13 cm.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for exponential decay, which is given by:

V(t) = V0*(1-r)^t

where V(t) is the value of the car after t years, V0 is the initial value of the car, r is the rate of depreciation per year, and t is the number of years.

In this case, V0 = $20,000, r = 15% = 0.15, and t = 3. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Answer:
<strong>300 items</strong>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The break-even point occurs when the total cost (fixed cost plus variable cost) equals the total revenue from selling the items. We can set up an equation to solve for the number of items that need to be sold to break even.
Let x be the number of items sold.
Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost per item * number of items
Total cost = $2000 + $10x
Total revenue = price per item * number of items
Total revenue = $20x

If the train covers 450 km in 3 hours, how long would it take the car to cover the same distance?
Answer: 300 km.

<strong>Answer: </strong>

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Let's convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour to kilometers per hour. We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes. So, to convert 450 km/h to km/min, we divide 450 by 60.
450 ÷ 60 = 7.5 km/min

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Since the train moves twice as fast as the car, we can divide the speed of the train by 2 to find the speed of the car.

Answer: 11 km/l
Explanation:
The efficiency decreases by 10% for every 10 km/h increase in speed over 60 km/h. As the speed increases from 60 km/h to 90 km/h, there is a 30 km/h increase.

Therefore, the efficiency decreases by 30% (3 x 10%) from its initial value of 15 km/l.

If the tailwind decreases their time by 30 minutes, what would be their speed without the wind?
Answer:
In the first 3 hours, the cyclist covers 150 km with the tailwind. Now, we need to find their speed without the wind.
Let's assume the cyclist's speed without the wind be x km/h. Then, their speed with the wind will be (x + wind speed) km/h.
Using the formula, distance = speed x time, we can write:
150 = (x + wind speed) x 3
The wind speed is the difference between the speed with and without the tailwind, so we can write:
150 = (x + (x - wind speed)) x 3

Answer: The volume of the cylinder is 45 cm³ (cubic centimeters).

To find the volume of a cylinder, we can use the formula V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.
Plugging in the given values, we get V = π(3 cm)²(5 cm) = 45π cm³.

Since the question asks for the answer in cubic centimeters, we can approximate π as 3.14 (a common approximation) to get V ≈ 45 × 3.14 cm³ = 141.3 cm³.

<h3><strong>How to solve this problem?</strong></h3>

If a car costs $20,000 and depreciates by 15% each year, we need to find the value of the car after 1 year. Depreciating 15% means the value of the car is decreasing by 15% each year.

We can calculate the value of the car after 1 year by subtracting 15% of the initial value from the initial value.

In this case, the initial value of the car is $20,000.

Answer: The new price of the bicycle is $144.

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the original price by the percentage increase. In this case, the percentage increase is 20%, which is equal to 0.2 as a decimal. Therefore, we can calculate the new price as follows:

New price = Original price × (1 + percentage increase)

Answer: The train will travel 100 miles.


To solve this problem, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. The train travels at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours (from 3 PM to 5 PM). Therefore, the distance traveled is 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles. However, we need to subtract 20 miles because the train started its journey at 3 PM instead of 4 PM (since 4 PM is 1 hour after 3 PM). Hence, the train will travel 120 miles - 20 miles = 100 miles by 5 PM.",Speed and Distance,Easy,False,10.382667303085327

Answer: $ _________


To find the original price, we can use the formula:
Original Price = (Discounted Price) / (1 - Discount Percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $24 and the discount percentage is 20% (or 0.2 when converted to a decimal).

Plugging in the values, we get:
Original Price = $24 / (1 - 0.2)

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
Original Price = $24 / 0.8

Dividing $24 by 0.8, we get:
Original Price = $30

Therefore, the original price of the book was $30.",Percentages,Medium,False,11.090173959732056

If a triangle has sides of lengths 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm, is it a right triangle?

Yes, the triangle is a right triangle.

Answer: $28.00
Explanation:
The sale price is 30% off the original price of $40. To calculate the sale price, we need to find 30% of $40. We can do this by multiplying $40 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal):
$40 x 0.3 = $12
This means that the discount is $12. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price:
$40 - $12 = $28
Therefore, the sale price of the book is $28.00.",Percentages,Medium,False,10.381708860397339

Answer: . (Simplify your answer, including the decimal point if it is necessary.)
The answer is 28 cm.
A square is a four-sided polygon with four equal sides and four right angles. The formula for calculating the perimeter of a square is:

Perimeter of the square = 4 x side length

Therefore, to find the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 7 cm, we can substitute the side length into the formula:

Perimeter of the square = 4 x 7 cm = 28 cm

Rounding the answer to the nearest whole number gives us 28 cm.",Geometry,Easy,False,9.244101762771606

Answer:

The answer is 17000

I just used a calculator.

3200

Step-by-step explanation:

The car lost $2000.

This means that the car is now worth $18,000.

$18,000.00 is 90% of the car's original value.

$18,000.00 = 90%

$20,000.00 = 100%

$1,000.00 = 10%

$20,000.00 = 100%

Answer:
The car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon.


Explanation:
To find the fuel efficiency, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the amount of gas used.

In this case, the car traveled 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas. So, we can set up the following equation:

Fuel Efficiency = $\frac{Total\ Distance\ Traveled}{Amount\ of\ Gas\ Used}$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Fuel Efficiency = $\frac{240\ miles}{8\ gallons}$
