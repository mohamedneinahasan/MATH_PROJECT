The question asks for the total increase of the revenue this year, compared to last year. The question doesn’t ask for the increase per se.
The question also does not ask for the percentage of the total revenue. It only asks for the total revenue.

The question indicates that the increase in revenue is $15 per $100.

<b><u>Solution</u></b>
Let $x$ be the number of Bag A sold

Answer: <strong>72/17 hours</strong>.

Why is this answer wrong?

I assumed that if one machine can complete a task in 12 hours, then in one hour, it can complete 1/12 of the task.

If another machine can complete the task in 16 hours, then in one hour, it can complete 1/16 of the task.

So, in one hour, both machines together can complete 1/12 + 1/16 of the task, which is 7/48 of the task.

If the car is currently worth $12,000, what will its value be after 3 years?
Answer:
The car’s value will be $8000 after 3 years.

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of exponential decay. Exponential decay occurs when a quantity decreases by a constant percentage at regular intervals. In this case, the car’s value decreases by 20% per year.

We can express the car’s value after t years using the formula:

V(t) = P(1 – r)^t

Where:
V(t) is the value of the car after t years
P is the initial value of the car
r is the rate of decay (in decimal form)
t is the number of years

Answer: $300

You can see how easy it is to use percentage when you need to determine a specific number from a percentage of it.

The trick for solving this problem is to know how to use the percentage symbol.

This symbol means that you are going to be taking a part of a number, multiplying it by 100, and then putting that number on the other side.

In this example, the man’s income is equal to $75, so he would have to spend $75 on groceries to make it a 25% of his income.

You can also use the percentage symbol to find out the percentage of a number.

These math problems demonstrate an interesting concept: if you change the order of the numbers in a question, the answer is the same. This is called the commutative property of multiplication.

The commutative property of multiplication states that the order of the numbers in a multiplication problem does not affect the answer. For example, 5 × 3 is the same as 3 × 5. This property is important in math because it helps us to understand how numbers work together to create different outcomes.

Answer: He spends $600 on rent.


To solve this problem, we need to use the percentage formula:
Percentage = (Part/Whole) * 100
In this case, the whole is the man's salary ($1,500), and the part is the amount he spends on rent. We need to find the part (the amount he spends on rent) as a percentage of the whole (his salary).
So, we can write:
40% = (Part/1500) * 100
Now, we can solve for the part (the amount he spends on rent):
40% = (Part/1500) * 10",Percentage Problems,Easy,0.017241379310344827,5.56331772444502e-232

289,A car travels 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas. What is the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon?,30 MPG,MPG = Distance / Gallons = 240 miles / 8 gallons = 30 MPG.,"Solve the following math problem: A car travels 240 miles on 8 gallons of gas. What is the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon?
Answer: 30 miles per gallon.

Now, this is a simple equation.
Multiply 240 by 8 to get 1,920.
Divide 1,920 by 240 to get 8.

The reason why the car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon and not 8 miles per gallon is that you need to know the average speed of the car to calculate its fuel efficiency.

Also, you need to know the amount of gas used to calculate the fuel efficiency per gallon.

In this case, the car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon.

Answer: 80

Now, let's solve it in a different way.
The equation for the book reading problem is p = 4n, where p is the total pages read and n is the number of people that have read the book.
To solve this equation, we need to find the value of p. To do this, we need to substitute the values of n and p into the equation.
In this case, we know that the book has been read by 4 people, so we can substitute n = 4 into the equation.
We also know that each person has read 20 pages, so we can substitute p = 20 into the equation.
This gives us the equation p =",Basic Arithmetic,Easy,0.027586206896551724,6.232719878487911e-232

Hint: Let the width of the rectangle be x. Then the length of the rectangle will be x + 4. We know that the area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. Hence, the area will be given by x(x + 4). Now, we use the given fact that the area of the rectangle is 60 cm² and equate it to x(x + 4). Solving the quadratic equation, we get the value of x and hence the dimensions of the rectangle.

Answer: $600

<h2>How to solve this problem:</h2>

In this problem, we need to find the sale price of a laptop that is on sale for 25% off. To do this, we can use the formula:

Sale Price = Original Price * (1 – Discount Rate)

In this case, the original price is $800, and the discount rate is 25%. We can plug these values into the formula to find the sale price:

Sale Price = $800 * (1 – 0.25)

Sale Price = $800 * 0.75

Answer:
The bike will cost $340 after 3 years.
Explanation:
Step 1: Calculate the depreciation factor. The depreciation factor is calculated by subtracting the depreciation rate from 100%. In this case, the depreciation rate is 15%, so the depreciation factor is 100% - 15% = 85%.
Step 2: Calculate the value of the bike after 1 year. To do this, multiply the initial value of the bike by the depreciation factor. In this case, the initial value of the bike is $400, so the value after 1 year is $400 x 0.85 = $340.

Answer: The sale price is $35.

If a sweater originally costs $50 and is on sale for 30% off, what is the sale price?

A: $35.

Explanation:

The sale price can be calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage and subtracting it from the original price.

Sale price = Original price - (Original price x Discount percentage)

In this case, the original price is $50 and the discount percentage is 30%.

Answer:
The car will be valued at $8,000 after 2 years.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

FV = PV * (1 - r/100)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value
r = Rate of Depreciation (20% in this case)
n = Number of Years (2 years in this case)

Plugging in the values:

Answer: The original price was $_____

A 25% discount means the shirt is sold for 75% of its original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Answer: There were originally 100 items.

The first step in solving this problem is to determine the percentage that was left after the store sold 60% of its inventory. This is done by subtracting the percentage that was sold from 100%.

100% - 60% = 40%

This means that after the store sold 60% of its inventory, it had 40% of the original inventory left.

The second step is to determine the number of items in the remaining inventory. This is done by multiplying the percentage of items left by the total number of items.

The second problem is easier to understand, but the first is a classic math question, designed to show how much more difficult it is for children to solve a problem when the numbers are in the wrong order.
This is something known as the “Magnitude Effect” – a finding that suggests that people are better at solving math problems when the numbers are in the correct order.

So, if you’re a parent whose child is struggling to learn math, it’s worth considering whether it’s because the numbers are in the wrong order.

If you're looking for the answer to this math problem, then you've come to the right place. The answer is 1/3.
To solve this problem, you need to understand the concept of probability. Probability is the likelihood or chance of an event happening. In this case, we are looking at the probability of picking a red ball from a box containing 2 red, 3 green, and 4 blue balls.
To calculate the probability, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking a red ball, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls in the box.

489,A train travels at a speed of 90 mph for 3 hours. How far does it travel?,270 miles,Distance = Speed × Time = 90 mph × 3 hours = 270 miles.,"Solve the following math problem: A train travels at a speed of 90 mph for 3 hours. How far does it travel?
Answer:

Please give me a step by step explanation.
Thanks!
3 hours travelling at 90 mph means that he has covered a distance of 90 miles in each of the 3 hours.

So, distance = 3 * 90 miles = 270 miles

The trick here is that if a train travels at a speed of 90 mph for 3 hours, then the train has covered 90 miles in the first hour, 90 miles in the second hour, 90 miles in the third hour.

This makes it a perfect example of addition, with the sum being 270 miles.

Now we add a little friction and make the problem more realistic. Let's say the worker is paid $15 an hour for 40 hours of work. If the worker is late to work more than 10 minutes, the worker is docked 15 minutes pay.

The worker is late by 11 minutes on three days. So the worker is docked 15 minutes pay on those three days. That is a total of 45 minutes.

A 45 minute pay cut is worth $11.25.

Answer: The total cost is $324.

Next, we need to determine the percent of the cost that is sales tax. To do this, we can subtract the original cost of the bicycle from the total cost and then divide that number by the original cost. The result will give us the percent of the total cost that is sales tax.

Percent of sales tax = (Total cost - Original cost) / Original cost

Percent of sales tax = ($324 - $300) / $300

Percent of sales tax = $24 / $300

Percent of sales tax = 0.08 or 8%

Therefore, the percent of the cost that is sales tax is 8",Tax,Medium,0.016,0.0

Answer: The volume of the cylinder is ___ $cm^3$.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.

In this case, we have r = 5 cm and h = 10 cm. So, using the formula, we get:

V = πr²h
V = π(5)²(10)
V = π(25)(10)
V = 250π cm²

Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is 250π cm².

Two hours later, a second train leaves city A traveling at 90 km/h. When will the second train catch up to the first?
Answer: The second train will catch up to the first train in 6 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in a certain amount of time. First, let's find the total distance traveled by the first train in 6 hours. Since it travels at 60 km/h, we can use the formula:

distance = speed * time

distance = 60 km/h * 6 hours

distance = 360 km

If the price of each item is $20, how many items must be sold to break even?
Answer:
Number of items to be sold = 100 items
To find the break even point, we should equate the cost to the revenue. The cost of the goods sold is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. The revenue from the sale of the goods is the product of the price and the number of items sold. We will use the following formulas:
Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost x Number of items sold
Revenue = Price x Number of items sold

If the train covers 450 km in 3 hours, how long would it take the car to cover the same distance?",6 hours,Train speed = 450 km / 3 hrs = 150 km/h; Car speed = 150/2 = 75 km/h; Time for car = 450/75 = 6 hours.,"Solve the following math problem: A train moves twice as fast as a car. If the train covers 450 km in 3 hours, how long would it take the car to cover the same distance?
Answer: It would take the car ___ hours to cover the same distance.

To solve this math problem, we need to use the concept of speed. Speed is the rate at which an object moves. It is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given that the train moves twice as fast as the car, we can assume that the car's speed is half of the train's speed.

Let's use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

For the train, the speed is:

Speed of train = 450 km / 3 hours = 150 km/hour

Since the car's speed is half of the train's speed, we have:

A second train leaves the same station at 11 AM and travels at 100 km/h in the same direction. At what time will the second train catch up with the first?
Answer: The second train will catch up with the first at 10:24 AM.
To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between the two trains when the second train catches up with the first. We can do this by using the formula: distance = rate x time.
For the first train, the distance traveled is 80 km/h x 3 hours = 240 km.
For the second train, the distance traveled is 100 km/h x 2 hours = 200 km.
The difference in distance between the two trains is 240 km - 200 km = 40 km.

Answer:
The probability is $\frac{1}{10}$ .

<h2>What is the probability of picking a blue ball?</h2>

In order to find the probability of picking a blue ball, we need to calculate the fraction of blue balls in the total number of balls.

The total number of balls in the box is 4 + 6 = 10.

The number of blue balls is 6.

Therefore, the probability of picking a blue ball is:

probability = number of blue balls / total number of balls probability = 6 / 10

Answer: 1/2


Explanation:
If a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices, we can represent it as 8/8.
If 3 slices are eaten, then the fraction of pizza eaten is 3/8.
To find the fraction of pizza left, we can subtract the fraction of pizza eaten from the whole pizza.
So, the fraction of pizza left is 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.
However, we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2.
5/8 ÷ 2/2 = 5/16
Therefore, 5/16 of the pizza is left.",Fractions,Easy,0.032520325203252036,5.56331772444502e-232

The answer is

Step-by-step explanation:

We need to solve for the variable x in the equation.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation by applying the inverse operations.

For the equation, we can start with the distributive property to multiply out the 2 inside the parentheses.

2(x-3) = 16

2x - 6 = 16

Subtract each side of the equation by -6 to isolate the variable.

2x - 6 + 6 = 16 + 6

2x = 22

Divide each side of the equation by 2 to isolate the variable.

Answer:
There’s a catch: You can only use four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), brackets, and the number 3 to calculate the solution.
The answer is 3.
That’s correct! This is because, if we multiply 3 with 90 and then divide it by 3, we will get the correct answer.

If it maintains the same speed, how far will it travel in 7 hours?
Answer:
The train will travel 350 miles in 7 hours.

The formula for calculating the distance traveled by a train is:
Distance = Speed * Time

We know that the train travels 150 miles in 3 hours, so we can use the formula to calculate the average speed of the train:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 50 miles per hour

Now we can use the formula to calculate the distance traveled by the train in 7 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 miles per hour * 7 hours

Then I would subtract 3 from both sides, giving me 5x = 3x + 15. Then I would subtract 3x from both sides. I would get 2x = 15. Finally, I would divide both sides by 2. I would get x = 7.5.

Answer: $100

Explanation:

To find the original price, we can use the formula:

Original price = discounted price / (1 - discount rate)

In this case, we know that the discounted price is $80 and the discount rate is 20%. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Original price = $80 / (1 - 0.20)

Original price = $80 / 0.8

Original price = $100

Answer: The father is years old and the son is years old.


The correct answer is:  The father is 26 years old and the son is 14 years old.

How to solve this math problem?

First, let’s assign a variable to the son’s age. We can call it x. Since the father is twice as old as the son, the father’s age can be represented as 2x.

Now we can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation:

x + 2x = 40

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The formula to find the volume of a sphere is:
V = 4/3 * π * r³
Where V is the volume, r is the radius, and π is the constant pi.
Substituting the given values, we get:
V = 4/3 * 3.14 * (3 cm)³

Answer: The sale price is $150.

In the given math problem, the original price of the product is $200. The sale price is found by subtracting 25% of the original price from the original price.

To calculate 25% of $200, we can simply multiply $200 by 0.25 (the decimal equivalent of 25%).

25% of $200 = 0.25 * $200 = $50

Answer: The width of the rectangle is ____ m.

Let's use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = L x W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. We are given that the area is 48 m² and the length is 12 m, so we can plug these values into the formula:

48 = 12 x W

To solve for W, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 12:

Answer: 90°

<b>Explanation:</b> The sum of any two angles in a triangle must be greater than the third angle. Therefore, if the two given angles measure 30° and 60°, the third angle must be greater than 90°.

The only angle that is greater than 90° and less than 180° is 90°, the measure of a right angle.

Therefore, the answer is 90°.",Geometry,Easy,0.023255813953488372,6.0358550325078056e-232
916,"If the average of four numbers is 25, what is their total sum?",100,Total sum = average × number of items = 25 × 4 = 100.,"Solve the following math problem: If the average of four numbers is 25, what is their total sum?
Answer: The total sum of the four numbers is 100.

In order to solve this problem, we can use the formula for the average of a set of numbers:

Average = Sum of numbers / Number of numbers

We know that the average of the four numbers is 25, so we can write:

25 = Sum of numbers / 4

To solve for the sum of the numbers, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

25 * 4 = Sum of numbers

100 = Sum of numbers

Therefore, the total sum of the four numbers is 100.",Basic Arithmetic,Easy,0.01785714285714286,5.527615446108862e-232

Answer: The length of one side is ? cm.

To solve the problem, we are given the area of a square and asked to find the length of one side. The formula for the area of a square is A = s², where A is the area and s is the length of one side.

We are given that the area is 49 cm², so we can plug this into the formula:

49 = s²

To solve for s, we need to take the square root of both sides:

√49 = s

49 = 7², so the square root of 49 is 7.

Therefore, the length of one side of the square is 7 cm.

The question is asking for the area of a circle with a radius of 3 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², where r is the radius. We are given the value of π as 3.14.

To find the area, we need to substitute the value of the radius into the formula and then multiply it by π.

Area = πr²

Answer: 1/2 cup of sugar

Explanation:

To work out how much sugar you need, you can do the following: 3/4 cup is the amount of sugar for the whole recipe. To make half of the recipe, you need to divide this amount by 2. When you divide a fraction by a whole number (in this case, 2), you can multiply the numerator (the top number) by the reciprocal of the denominator (the bottom number). So, 3/4 divided by 2 is the same as multiplying 3/4 by 1/2. When you multiply these two fractions together, you get 3/8.
