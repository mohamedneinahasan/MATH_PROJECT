Answer: The two numbers are 20 and 10.

Step-by-step explanation:
Let the two numbers be x and y. We have two equations:

1) \(x + y = 30\) (The sum of the two numbers is 30)
2) \(x - y = 10\) (Their difference is 10)

We can solve this system of equations by adding both equations together to eliminate y:

\(x + y + x - y = 30 + 10\)

This simplifies to:

\(2x = 40\)

Answer: 40%

To find the percentage of boys in the school, first, determine the number of boys. Since there are 200 students in total and 120 of them are girls, you can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys:

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 200 - 120
Number of boys = 80

Now that you know there are 80 boys, you can calculate the percentage of boys by dividing the number of boys by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100:

What is the range of possible lengths for the third side?
Answer: The range of possible lengths for the third side of a triangle can be determined using the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Given two sides of lengths 7 cm and 10 cm, let's denote the length of the third side as \(x\).

According to the Triangle Inequality Theorem:

1. \(x + 7 > 10\)
2. \(x + 10 > 7\)
3. \(7 + 10 > x\)

From these inequalities, we can find the range for \(x\):

What number of items sold maximizes revenue?
Answer: The number of items sold that maximizes revenue is 50.

To find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points of the function R(x) = 100x - x². We do this by taking the derivative of R(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.

The derivative of R(x) is:

R'(x) = d/dx (100x - x²) = 100 - 2x

How much of each should be used?
Answer: The chemist should use 80 liters of the 20% saline solution and 120 liters of the 60% saline solution.

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

Let \(x\) represent the amount of 20% saline solution (in liters) that is mixed, and let \(y\) represent the amount of 60% saline solution (in liters) that is mixed.

We know two things:
1. The total volume of the mixture must be 200 liters.
2. The final mixture must have a concentration of 40%.

Answer: The product's cost is $160. 

To find the cost, we can use the formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost

Given that the profit is 25% of the cost, we can write:

Profit = 0.25 * Cost

We also know that the selling price is the sum of the cost and the profit:

Selling Price = Cost + Profit

Substituting the profit equation into the selling price equation gives us:

Selling Price = Cost + (0.25 * Cost)

Now, we can solve for the cost by isolating it on one side of the equation:

Answer: The width of the rectangle is 8 cm and the length is 24 cm.

Step-by-step explanation:

Let's denote:
- \(w\) as the width of the rectangle,
- \(l\) as the length of the rectangle.

From the given information, we know that:
1. \(l = 3w\), because the length is three times the width.
2. The perimeter \(P = 2l + 2w = 48\) cm, because the perimeter is the sum of all sides of the rectangle.

Answer: Given that the ratio of cats to dogs is 3:4, and there are 12 cats, we can find the number of dogs as follows:

1. First, determine the scale factor by which the ratio needs to be multiplied to match the actual number of cats. Since the ratio suggests 3 cats for every unit of dogs, and there are actually 12 cats, we divide the number of cats by the cat part of the ratio: \(12 \div 3 = 4\). This means each unit in our ratio represents 4 animals.

997,"If a box holds 12 kg of rice and you take out 4 kg, how much rice is left?",8 kg,Rice left = total rice - rice taken out = 12 - 4 = 8.,"Solve the following math problem: If a box holds 12 kg of rice and you take out 4 kg, how much rice is left?
Answer: If a box originally holds 12 kg of rice and you remove 4 kg, then there would be \(12 - 4 = 8\) kg of rice left in the box. 

To break it down:
- Start with the total amount of rice: 12 kg.
- Subtract the amount taken out: \(12 - 4 = 8\).
- Therefore, the amount of rice left is: 8 kg.

This straightforward calculation shows that after removing 4 kg from a 12 kg box of rice, you are left with 8 kg of rice.",Basic Arithmetic,Easy,0.03669724770642201,1.6650753477432036e-155
998,"If a farmer has 5 acres of land and plants corn on 2 acres, how many acres are left?",3 acres,Acres left = total acres - acres planted = 5 - 2 = 3.,"Solve the following math problem: If a farmer has 5 acres of land and plants corn on 2 acres, how many acres are left?
Answer: The farmer has 3 acres left for other crops or purposes since 5 - 2 = 3.

Explanation:
The original question involves basic subtraction. It states that a farmer has 5 acres of land and dedicates 2 acres to planting corn. To find out how many acres are left, we subtract the number of acres used for corn from the total acres:

\[ \text{Total acres} - \text{Acres for corn} = \text{Acres left} \]

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Therefore, there are 3 acres left for the farmer to use for other crops or purposes. This straightforward calculation demonstrates the application of subtraction in real-world scenarios, specifically in managing resources like land",Basic Arithmetic,Easy,0.02985074626865672,1.5127940274419968e-155
999,"If the value of x in the equation 3x = 12 is what, what is x?",4,Let x be the unknown; 3x = 12; x = 12 / 3 = 4.,"Solve the following math problem: If the value of x in the equation 3x = 12 is what, what is x?
Answer: x = 4

Step-by-step explanation:

To solve for x, you need to isolate x on one side of the equation. 

Given the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to get x alone:
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{12}{3} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, x is equal to 4.",Basic Algebraic Equations,Easy,0.027027027027027025,6.130341565759569e-232
1000,"If you have $20 and spend $4.50, how much do you have left?",$15.50,Amount left = total amount - amount spent = 20 - 4.5 = 15.5.,"Solve the following math problem: If you have $20 and spend $4.50, how much do you have left?
Answer: If you start with $20 and spend $4.50, you can calculate the remaining amount by subtracting the spent amount from the initial amount:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Spent Amount} \]

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$20 - \$4.50 \]

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$15.50 \]

So, after spending $4.50, you have $15.50 left.",Basic Arithmetic,Easy,0.052631578947368425,6.211555838206664e-232
