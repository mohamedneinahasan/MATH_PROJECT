Answer: Let's start by using the formula distance = speed x time. We know the speed is 30 meters per second, and the time is 40 seconds. So the distance traveled by the train is:

distance = speed x time
distance = 30 m/s x 40 s
distance = 1200 meters

Now we need to find the length of the bridge. We know that the total distance traveled by the train is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. So we can write:

total distance = length of train + length of bridge

We already know the length of the train is 400 meters, so we can substitute that in",Distance-Rate-Time,Hard,0.013793103448275862,5.232135586792358e-232

So, we can write the equation: 0.8x = $40.
To find the original price, we need to solve this equation for x.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8, we get:
x = $40 / 0.8 = $50.
Therefore, the original price of the shirt was $50.

Answer: Let x be the age of the friend who left. Then, the total age of the remaining friends is 150 - x. We know that the average age of the remaining friends is 31, so we can set up the equation:
(150 - x) / 4 = 31

y = x + 2 (Equation 2)
We can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for x:
3x + 4(x+2) = 24
3x + 4x + 8 = 24
7x = 16
x = 16/7
Now, we can use Equation 2 to solve for y:
y = x + 2
y = 16/7",Systems of Equations,Hard,0.07017543859649122,0.0

Water is being drained at a rate of 5 liters per hour and added at a rate of 10 liters per hour. How long will it take to fill the container?
Answer: To find the time it takes to fill the container, we need to determine the net rate at which the water is being added. The rate of water being drained is 5 liters per hour, and the rate of water being added is 10 liters per hour. Therefore, the net rate of water being added is 10 - 5 = 5 liters per hour.

Next, we can use the formula: time = amount / rate. In this case, the amount is 200 liters and the rate is 5 liters per hour. Plugging in the values, we have: time = 200 / 5 = 40 hours.

Answer: Let's assume the width of the garden is $x$ meters. Then the length of the garden is $x + 4$ meters.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula $P = 2l + 2w$, where $P$ is the perimeter, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.
So, in this case, we can write the equation $48 = 2(x + 4) + 2x$.

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the effect of the river's flow on the boat's speed. When the boat moves upstream against the current, its effective speed is the difference between its speed in still water and the river's speed. Thus, the boat's speed upstream is 8 km/h - 4 km/h = 4 km/h. To travel 16 km upstream at this speed, the boat will take 16 km ÷ 4 km/h = 4 hours.

Answer: Since the vertex of the quadratic function is (3, -5), we know that the equation of the function can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 5$, where $a$ is a constant. To find the minimum value of the function, we need to find the value of $a$. 

We know that the minimum value of the function occurs at the vertex, so we substitute the coordinates of the vertex into the equation: 

$-5 = a(3-3)^2 - 5$

Answer: We can start by finding the number of girls in the class. Since there are 30 students total and 18 are boys, then there are 30 - 18 = 12 girls in the class. To find the fraction of the class that are girls, we divide the number of girls by the total number of students: 12/30. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6: 12/30 = 2/5.
