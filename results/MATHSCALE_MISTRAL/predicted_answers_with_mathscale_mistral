Time = Distance / Speed = 300 miles / 60 mph = 5 hours.,"Solve the following math problem: A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours. How long will it take to travel 300 miles?
Answer: To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the time it takes to travel 300 miles as ""x"" hours. The proportion can be written as:

120 miles / 2 hours = 300 miles / x hours

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

120 * x = 2 * 300

Simplifying the equation, we have:

120x = 600

Answer: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of inverse proportion. Inverse proportion states that as one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases, and vice versa, while their product remains constant.

Let's denote the number of workers as W and the number of hours as H. According to the problem, we have the following proportion:

5 workers * 12 hours = 3 workers * H hours

To find the value of H, we can cross-multiply and solve for H:

5 * 12 = 3 * H

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula distance = speed x time. We know the distance is 280 miles and the speed is 70 mph. Let's use the formula to find the time it will take to travel that distance:

distance = speed x time
280 = 70 x time

To solve for time, we need to divide both sides by 70:

We can solve for one variable in terms of the other using $l = 500 - w$, and substitute into the area equation to get $A = w(500 - w) = 500w - w^2$. To maximize the area, we take the derivative with respect to $w$ and set it equal to zero: $\frac{dA}{dw}",Optimization,Hard,5

If it travels upstream against a current of 10 km/h, what is the speed of the boat relative to the riverbank?
Answer: Let x be the speed of the boat relative to the riverbank. Then, the speed of the boat upstream is x - 10 km/h. We know that the boat can travel 30 km/h in still water, so the equation is:
x - 10 = 30

Answer: Let x be the number of adult tickets sold, and y be the number of child tickets sold. We have two unknowns, so we need two equations to solve for x and y. 

From the problem, we know that:
x + y = 400 (because there are 400 seats)

If the train covers 450 km in 3 hours, how long would it take the car to cover the same distance?
Answer: Let's assume that the car's speed is x km/h. Since the train moves twice as fast as the car, its speed would be 2x km/h. We can use the formula distance = speed x time to solve the problem. 

For the train, we have:

If it initially travels 15 km/l and 50 kg of weight is added, what is the new efficiency?
Answer: First, we need to determine how many times the car's fuel efficiency decreases by 5%. Since the car gains 50 kg of weight, we need to find the number of 10 kg increments in 50 kg.
50 kg / 10 kg = 5 increments

Now, we need to calculate the decrease in fuel efficiency.
5 increments * 5% = 25% decrease

Next, we need to subtract the decrease from the initial fuel efficiency.
15 km/l - 25% = 15 km/l - (0.25 * 15 km/l) = 15 km/l -",Percentages,Hard,2

Novels are priced at $15 each and comics at $5 each. If a customer buys 4 novels and 6 comics, what is the total amount they spend?
Answer: To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the novels and the comics separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 novels is 4 * $15 = $60.
The cost of 6 comics is 6 * $5 = $30.

A second train leaves the same station at 11 AM and travels at 100 km/h in the same direction. At what time will the second train catch up with the first?
Answer: Let's call the time the second train travels t (in hours) and the distance traveled by the first train d (in km). We know that the first train has been traveling for 2 hours before the second train starts, so the second train has to catch up to the first train by traveling the same distance in less time. Therefore, we can write:

d = 80(t + 2)  (distance traveled by the first train)
d = 100t      (distance traveled by the second train)

We can set these two equations equal to each other to find the time when the second train catches up with the first:

Answer: Let x be the plane’s airspeed in still air. With a tailwind, the plane’s effective speed is x + 60 km/h. We can use the formula distance = speed × time to solve for x:
1,200 km = (x + 60 km/h) × 2 h
Simplifying the equation, we get:
600 km/h = x + 60 km/h

Answer: To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

Average speed = total distance / total time

Let's first calculate the total distance traveled. The distance traveled in the first 2 hours is:

distance = speed x time = 5 km/h x 2 h = 10 km

The distance traveled in the next 3 hours is:

distance = speed x time = 4 km/h x 3 h = 12 km

If the total bill is $40, how many texts were sent?",125 messages,Let x = number of texts; 25 + 0.12x = 40; Solve for x.,"Solve the following math problem: A phone bill includes a monthly base charge of $25 and $0.12 per text message. If the total bill is $40, how many texts were sent?
Answer: Let x be the number of text messages sent.
The cost of the text messages is 0.12x.
The total cost of the bill is the sum of the base charge and the cost of the text messages, which is 25 + 0.12x.
We know that the total bill is $40, so we can set up the equation:
25 + 0.12x = 40

When will the second bus catch up?,9 AM,Distance first bus travels in 1 hour = 60 km; Relative speed = 80 - 60 = 20 km/h; Time to catch up = 60 / 20 = 3 hours.,"Solve the following math problem: A bus leaves at 6 AM and travels at 60 km/h. Another bus leaves the same station at 7 AM at 80 km/h. When will the second bus catch up?
Answer: Let's call the time the second bus takes to catch up as t. At that point, the first bus has been traveling for t+1 hours. We know that distance = speed x time. Therefore, the distance traveled by the first bus is 60(t+1) km, and the distance traveled by the second bus is 80t km. Since they meet at the same point, the distance traveled by both buses is the same. Hence, we can set up the equation 60(t+1) = 80t. Solving for t, we get t = 3. Therefore, the second bus will catch up at 10 AM.",Distance-Rate-Time,Medium,1

659,A runner travels 9 km in 40 minutes. What is their average speed in km/h?,13.5 km/h,Average speed = Distance / Time = 9 / (40/60) = 13.5 km/h.,"Solve the following math problem: A runner travels 9 km in 40 minutes. What is their average speed in km/h?
Answer: To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. Since we are given the distance in km and the time in minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 40 minutes is equal to $\frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3}$ hours. Thus, the average speed is $\frac{9 \text{ km}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ h}} = \frac{27}{2} \text{ km/h}$.

0.5p + 1.2n = 8.2 (since the total cost of pencils and pens is $8.20)
We can simplify the first equation to p = 10 - n and substitute it into the second equation:
0.5(10 - n) + 1.2n = 8.2
